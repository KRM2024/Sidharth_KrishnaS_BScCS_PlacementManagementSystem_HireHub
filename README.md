## 🏁 **Final Note**

This project was developed as part of the **Mini Project requirement for Semester 2** at K.R. Mangalam University.  
Through this project, we learned how to build a scalable and real-time web application by integrating front-end development with cloud-based backend services.

Our goal was to not only solve a practical institutional problem but also apply our growing technical skills in a collaborative, professional workflow.  
We look forward to evolving this project with future features such as:
- Admin management panel  
- Recruiter login & job posting module  
- Resume uploads  
- Real-time notifications  

Thank you for exploring our project!
