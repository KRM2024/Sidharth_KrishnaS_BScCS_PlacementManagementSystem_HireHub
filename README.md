## 🏁 **Final Note**

This project reflects our collective effort in understanding how real-world web platforms are built — from designing a problem-solving idea, building responsive front-end pages, integrating backend functionality with Firebase, and deploying it live using GitHub Pages.

It challenged us to think critically, collaborate effectively, and apply programming skills in a way that solves practical problems.  
**HireHub** is more than just a student project — it is a scalable, real-world application with future potential for institutions, startups, and recruitment platforms alike.

Thank you for taking the time to explore our work! 🙌
